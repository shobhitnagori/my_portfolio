# Portfolio — Product Owner/Technical Program Manager (Analytics & AI)

I am a Technical Program Manager/Product Owner specializing in the delivery of **Analytics platforms and AI-powered systems**, with a focus on turning ambiguous business problems into **scalable, production-ready solutions**.
My work sits at the intersection of **Data Engineering, Data Analytics & Business Intelligence, Applied AI (LLMs), and Program Execution** — bridging strategy, architecture, and delivery across cross-functional teams.
This portfolio highlights selected systems, frameworks, and case studies that demonstrate **how I think, design, and execute**.

## What I Do

- Translate business problems into technical architectures and delivery plans  
- Lead end-to-end execution of analytics and AI systems  
- Design scalable solutions with Domain Expertise  
- Define KPIs, success metrics, and evaluation frameworks  
- Align engineers, data scientists, and stakeholders around outcomes

## Selected Case Studies

### 1. AI-Driven Survey Analytics & ETL Automation
**Problem:**  
Manual ETL maintenance and brittle mappings slowed analysis and increased error risk as survey instruments evolved.

**Solution:**  
Designed a multi-agent system that:
- Reads SPSS variable *metadata* (labels, values — not respondent data)
- Classifies variables into conceptual KPI groups
- Detects changes across file versions and changelogs
- Proposes ETL and mapping updates with human-in-the-loop validation

**Impact:**  
- Reduced manual ETL updates significantly  
- Improved robustness to survey changes  
- Enabled faster turnaround for analytics delivery
